 Yelp is unusable on any other platform/ browser, why would they set up an platform that cannot be viewed online? They created Yelp just to funnel users to install their glorified reviewing app. I just want to make it clear that the creators of said app are using the Apple app store to pedal downloads by trafficking people from external sources and filling their app store page with biased data/information just to manipulate/trick unexpecting consumers. Such businesses practices are crazy unethical!

Absolutely disgusting. I have moved onto other apps/platforms that respect their user’s honesty and do not punish them for reviews.

I’ve called multiple times to complain and I am always told the same thing that “they are short handed and don’t have anyone to work there”. That’s ridiculous. Pull someone from the main store and have them work out there. You wouldn’t close the main store if you were short handed so why the fuel center?

Being downtown they are busy and have an urban feel, diverse and sometimes fast paced. It’s one of the cleanest locations I’ve experienced when one considers the volume they do.  

Many of us appreciate the service of Alexa, the evening shift manager, and the manner in which she treats her employees. In recent weeks I’ve noticed an increase in business m, as it’s becoming more of a college hand out, in addition to their other diverse clientele.

Recently I had breakfast with a radiologist who made a valid point, ie the music is interesting and at a perfect level and that there was so much work space with lighting that was ideal, and she pointed out how the staff is so inviting. I do agree.  They work as a team, and this comes right from the management and shift supervisor.

Another friend of mine commented that she comes here because of the upbeat atmosphere.

Today’s service was outstanding.  Most people downtown agree with me.

Alexa has worked for Starbucks for more than a decade and is so loyal and devoted.

They do much right at this location and I am appreciative.

183,2019-01-31 03:44:12,"Still my preferred app to check out restaurants. 

A couple of suggestions.

I like that people can check in. 
It would make more sense if there was an option to geographically base the check ins.  Say for example you go a business trip and there was an awesome restaurant you visited but couldn't remember what the name was or where it was located. While you remembered to check in, it was roughly about 3 years ago. You have to spend several minutes scrolling and scrolling through your saved check ins to find the general timeframe of when you went there. More often than not, I will skip over it and it just leads to frustration.  

Make check ins more useful. The same repetitive questions keep coming up. For attire, answering either casual or formal would generally suffice.  I don't think people filter places specifically looking for a divvy or hipster venue.  I think one of the more useful things you could add is average wait time and harness the database of loyal users. If you could ask if wait time is less than 5 min, less than 30 min, or greater than an hour for walk ins, that would help users prioritize their list of possible selections.

The owner of Luma fitness Connor Waggoner scammed me out of over $1000 dollars
I signed up for a year membership in March 2023 .
In November 2024 I called and asked him to cancel my membership due to health issues. He said that he couldn’t help me and kept charging me every month until it’s expiration in March 2024. Sadly, he gave me no choice but to ride out the term of the membership even though I was unable to attend the gym! In March 2024 conner told me the membership would expire on its own. I trusted him! Connor did not cancel my membership as he said he would! Instead, the membership went up $50, without my permission or my knowledge! Six months went by when I discovered that he had been charging me without my permission. Even after I told him that I was diagnosed with cancer, he did not care and refused to reimburse any of the money taken out of my account since March 2024!! 
After being diagnosed with cancer, Connor Waggoner kept charging me.
I went to the gym, pleading with him in person.  He told me that he would NOT refund any money or even partially reimburse me. He admitted that he remembers the conversation we had last November and remembers me wanting to cancel.

2. There are positive reviews that were left by my (former) customers. Some of these comments were hidden. Customers have contacted Yelp and confirmed themselves, and yet, these comments are still being hidden.

3. I leave a very few bad reviews on companies. One of my bad review have been erased. Rewrote the review again and in within a week, it got deleted. Most likely that specific company have paid big bucks to have Yelp removed my review.

So, it is up to you if you like to use Yelp service for your personal and business experiences. I don’t trust Yelp since it is seem like they are manipulating the companies, companies’ reputation, and it’s customers to take advantage of the situation and get more money off from it.

We order drinks and my husband who specifically asked for a NA beer was told it was on draft. We questioned this as that is not the norm. He is in recovery for three years now.

The manager blatantly told me that she did me a favor by giving us a new coffee in the first place and they don’t do exchanges or refunds. Seems to me they also don’t guarantee a good product.

Hello,

We're reaching out to let you know that our moderators removed your review of Peoria Artisan Brewery.

We typically remove reviews that describe individuals or situations with objectionable terms that go beyond simply reviewing a customer experience with a business. We ask that reviewers avoid commentary that reinforces negative cultural stereotypes, makes light of physical or sexual violence, or otherwise includes unnecessarily graphic or offensive descriptions.

In this case, we felt that your content crossed that line, even if you didn't intend it to. Please be aware that any further content you post that violates our guidelines in this manner may be subject to removal without notification.",1,False,Inchik1981,YELP DISCRIMINATIION!!!,

To this point, I’d like to put forth the argument that many update requests from App developers, including Yelp, are not necessary, at all. And, in fact, may not serve its users, but its developers. Why, you ask? Well, my friends, that is another conversation not for this space. At least not now. 

A better explanation to motivate user updates is very specific, VERY useful feature additions, and, of course, increased listings.

A bland and non descriptive “fixed bugs”, says nothing, and actually has the potential to cover any and all activity and adjustments by the developer, that we users do not want done in the first place. 

If the update requests that come through by app developers more and more frequently these days are about bugs constantly, why is it that my apps have never crashed or behaved strangely, even as I miss multitudes of updates?

It just opens the app to the home page! What’s the point in having that feature if it doesn’t do what it claims to do?

The restaurant was barely full when we arrived. We noticed the tables and chairs were placed very close to each other but no one was seated at the table next to us which made us comfortable. 
Soon, however, another couple was seated there. We scooted our table a little further away from them. Very shortly, people were pouring in... many without masks. Every table was taken and the  seats at the bar were mostly full.
There was no social distancing in place at all. Also, we noticed several of the wait staff wore masks that were slipping off their faces.
I complained to the waitress and asked to see the manager at the end. His response was “sorry.”

Forced to update yelp after it repeatedly crashed after updating iOS.  Yelp changed the layout, and now you see either the map or the search results list taking most of the screen, but no more list of restaurants side by side to a map area.  Switching between landscape and portrait mode changes nothing.  You can move the slider bar--but as soon as you press anywhere in either area, that section goes back to taking up most of the screen.  So, the slider bar isn't very useful because it doesn't stay put.

If you're researching restaurants in a map area, do it in Google Maps first.  In Google maps, type in restaurants, <city> in their search bar, then move/zoom the map to a specific area, then press (search this area). You'll see the list of different restaurants in that map area, side by side next to a map. Select a restaurant and scroll to see reviews.

If you know anything about franchise owners, they do not get to set their prices.  He should have known that if he is really in the business community.  The one good review he gave at the end was that the products were great.

Giving the same response you did the first time I reported a racist review means your bull content guidelines and policy needs an update to include anti-racism on your platform. :) please rescind your response it’s incredibly embarrassing. 

Anyway I’m not requesting a second evaluation because your platforms guidelines are obviously consistent with racist ideologies or it would in fact reflect otherwise in an appropriate response to racist content on your platform.  xoxo

Previous, well standing, glowingly negative review of Yelps violent racist content guideline that WILL NOT change until their policies reflect a socially-responsible-at-bare-minimum-stance: 
They allow racist reviews under the guise of not wanting to stifle the creativity of some mediocre person that clings to violent ideologies. They literally will not deny the review is racist but simply will allow it to exist on their platform. I’d bet the second someone says something “anti” Caucasian they’ll ban them swiftly if the review even makes it to post. Lol.

Called today & found out that you need to complain every time costs go up & they will offer a lower price.  Sounds like Xfinity to me.

DO NOT HIRE THIS COMPANY!  
They claim to be Professional Movers but trust me...they are NOT!  
I used All American Van Lines based in Farmingdale NY specifically because they stated they were professional Piano Movers.  And of course I was charged extra to move the Piano.  
When I unwrapped my beautiful white Baby Grand Piano I was heartbroken to observe that it had extensive damage.
Arel the Manager offered to reimburse me $100, even though the repair cost $450.  But he wanted me to sign and notarize a Form that forbids the Customer from writing a Review!
That’s unethical and goes against every American’s right to Freedom of Speech.
All American Van Lines thinks they can shield themselves from poor Reviews by bribing their Customers for $100???   Not this Customer!!
I experienced multiple problems with All American.
Both my Bedroom sets were assembled incorrectly and they had to send a Team to rectify the mistakes.
They damaged and chipped pieces of my furniture.
They ran out of proper moving supplies and wrapped my good Dining Room Chairs in dirty moving blankets.  They chipped paint off the newly painted walls.  They took hours longer than required because they were Bunglers -  far from professional movers!

A. Reviews need to be semi-anonymous (which Yelp enforces by excluding the last name, showing a minimal pic of the person, and allowing some bio details at the consumer’s preference)

B. Businesses need the opportunity to respond to both positive and negative reviews, and have the opportunity to resolve any negative issues (some business owners/managers have routinely attempted to resolve issues—which offers a great deal of comfort to the consumer)

Yelp also has a relatively objective way of grading the legitimacy of the reviewer via the Elite rating assigned, number of friends and number of reviews.

I have not been here in such a great while. I was a regular when I was working in the area some years ago. The restaurant has changed management, servers, and chef it seems.

Their seating has change quite a bit. In the past you were able to just walk in and someone would seat you or you would be told to pick your own seat.

The new change now is that you most grab a menu, wait in line then place and pay for your order and then find a seat.

Not really sure if this is really the norm or if I perhaps was directed to do so when I came in today.

You use to be ale to find a seat or be seated, place your order and after you finish you pay for your meal. The norm for most restaurants....

I love being able to find the reviews and photos of a place quickly and the sense community I’ve discovered via yelp.

I had a five minute conversation with her about my history with it and that it has been effective.  I have no history of abuse at the age of 54.  She expressed trepidation about prescribing narcotics because, I inferred, she’s afraid of getting in trouble because some people abuse them.  She didn’t even want to try.  Her office had no idea what my 5 minute office visits would cost, neither did the billing department.  I was charged $75 up front and told I would be billed the rest later.  The follow up bill for my 5 minutes was $167; so $242 for a big fat “No,” and she didn’t even call me herself.  Her very capable and kind assistant called me.

 I recently made up my mind to buy a organic vitamin D air bottle on wish. It says that it will help me breathe, and I have been having trouble breathing for around 3 years now. The package arrived in 2 days like it said, but the moment I opened the can, the air disappointingly spilled all over my Supreme shirt. I contacted the manager to explain my issue and find out if they could send a replacement, but the only person that picked up was the man’s grandmother, who proceeded to persuade me to buy her homemade toothpaste. She seemed really sad when I said no, so I regretfully spent $250 on a gallon of the stuff. After one week of brushing my teeth with the brown paste, I began to occasionally start aggressively vomiting. I put the can in my cabinet and the vomiting got better, but overnight my dog snuck into my bathroom and opened the cabinet. He ate the entire tub of toothpaste and developed a stomach tumor. I paid 9,000 dollars for his hospital bills, but alas, he passed away. I cannot forget what this air has done to me. I am 20,000 dollars in debt and living in peoples walls. I hope that none of you ever find yourself in this situation.

Clean-up was very thorough - no signs of nails or any debris from the removal of the old roof.  I was quite impressed! 

Six hours after arriving, your trucks pulled away as if work had never been done, except for the look of the pristine great new roof left behind. 

I appreciate the practiced and competent work of your business which is so hard to find these days. My neighbors asked about your services when they saw the work being done. They complemented your company and asked for your contact information.

If I post a review I would like it seen just to know that it may help someone. If it isn't going to be seen, why post a review? Yelp's customers aren't being heard.

They (and we yelpers) work hard to keep cheaters and fakers out of the system. if a review is suspect, report it!

Yelp’s algorithm frequently promotes negative reviews, making it challenging for businesses to maintain a fair online presence. Moreover, the lack of transparency in how reviews are filtered and displayed raises concerns about the platform’s integrity.

Attempts to resolve issues through Yelp’s support system are often met with minimal assistance, leaving business owners feeling unheard and powerless. The platform’s approach seems more geared towards pushing paid advertising rather than providing genuine support for businesses trying to manage their online reputation.

Since the pandemic I have gotten off Xanax but cannot just stop Zoloft as it is dangerous.  It must be gradually reduced with your doctor’s supervision. I’m taking 100mg.

The Vegetable Tempura was out of this world.  We both had Shrimp Pad Thai, an Asian noodle dish with Shrimp Added.  Again it was superb.

Not a mistake an employee made one day that’s going to stay forever in those pages.

One of the ways we try to help Yelp users discover local businesses is by using automated software to showcase reliable reviews.

The problem with this decision by Yelp is in the question of who decides what is racist and what is a legitimate complaint?

Mob rule by a vocal minority on social media is no way to run a business or society. How can anyone see the videos of innocent diners getting accosted during their meal by an actual mob and think that is a good thing?

Yelp is a directory that requests the consumer to review a business and then doesn’t treat all reviews equally.
